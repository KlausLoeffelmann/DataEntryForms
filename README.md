# DataEntryForms, CodeGen, Binding and more

My playground for a few ideas I have about new ways of DataBinding, Dynamic Front-End-Generation, letting the new VB and C# Code Generators help with that, 
and exploring easier ways to get typical, type-safe data entry forms designed at Design Time.

Nothing yet to talk about, but you can certainly take a look and comment or contribute ideas. :-)
